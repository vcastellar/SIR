\title{Register an epidemiological model}
\usage{
register_epi_model(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} on success.
}
\description{
Registers an object of class \code{"epi_model"} in the internal
model registry of the package.

The registry is an in-memory environment that stores epidemiological
models by name. Once registered, a model becomes discoverable through
\code{\link{list_models}} and retrievable via \code{\link{get_model}}.

This mechanism allows users to extend the framework with custom models
that can be used in simulation workflows or in the Shiny application.
}
\details{
The model is stored using its \code{name} field as identifier.
Model names must be unique within the current R session.

Attempting to register a model with a name that already exists in the
registry results in an error.

The registry is session-scoped and is reinitialized when the package
is reloaded.
