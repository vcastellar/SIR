\usage{
epi_model(
  name,
  rhs,
  par_names,
  states,
  derived = character(0),
  lower = NULL,
  upper = NULL,
  defaults = NULL,
  init = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character scalar giving the name of the model.}

\item{rhs}{A function defining the right-hand side of the system of
differential (or difference) equations. The function must be compatible
with the simulation backend used by \code{simulate_epi()}.}

\item{par_names}{Character vector with the names of the model parameters.}

\item{states}{Character vector giving the names of the compartmental state
variables of the model. Each state name must be unique.}

\item{derived}{Optional character vector giving the names of derived
variables returned by the RHS and extracted by \code{simulate_epi()}.}

\item{lower}{Optional named numeric vector giving lower bounds for model
parameters. Names must match \code{par_names}.}

\item{upper}{Optional named numeric vector giving upper bounds for model
parameters. Names must match \code{par_names}.}

\item{defaults}{Optional named numeric vector of default parameter values.
Names must match \code{par_names}.}

\item{init}{Optional named numeric vector of initial values for the state
variables. Names must match \code{states}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"epi_model"} containing the model definition.
}
\description{
Creates an \code{epi_model} object describing the structure of a deterministic
compartmental epidemiological model. The model definition includes the
system of equations, state variables, optional derived variables, parameter
names.
}
\details{
The resulting object is a \emph{model definition} and does not perform any
simulation by itself. It is intended to be used by downstream functions such
as \code{simulate_epi()}.
