\title{Summarize a simulated epidemic}
\usage{
\method{summary}{epi_sim}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}.}

\item{...}{Currently unused; included for compatibility with generic
\code{\link{summary}}.}
}
\value{
A named list with summary statistics describing the simulated epidemic.
}
\description{
Summary method for objects of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}. The function computes and returns a small set of
epidemiologically meaningful summary quantities derived from the simulation.
}
\details{
The summary includes:
\describe{
\item{model}{The epidemic model simulated (e.g. \code{"sir"} or \code{"sirs"}).}
\item{R0}{The basic reproduction number, computed as
\eqn{R_0 = \beta / \gamma}.}
\item{peak_I}{The maximum number of infectious individuals observed during
the simulation.}
\item{total_infections}{The total number of infection events, computed as
the maximum value of the cumulative infection variable \code{C(t)}.}
}

This method is automatically dispatched when calling \code{summary()} on an
object of class \code{"sim_epi"}.

sim <- simulate_epi(n_days = 300, model = "sirs", omega = 1/180, seed = 1)
