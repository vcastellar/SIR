\title{Epidemiological roles vocabulary}
\usage{
.epi_role_vocab()
}
\value{
A character vector of valid epidemiological role names.
}
\description{
Defines the standard vocabulary of epidemiological roles supported by the
package. Roles assign semantic meaning to state variables or auxiliary outputs
of an epidemic model (e.g. infectious, incidence).

Models declaring roles outside this vocabulary will be rejected by
\code{epi_model()}, ensuring semantic consistency across models and
epidemiological metrics.
}
\details{
The following roles are currently supported:

\itemize{
\item \strong{susceptible}: Individuals susceptible to infection.
\item \strong{exposed}: Infected but not yet infectious individuals.
\item \strong{infectious}: Infectious individuals.
\item \strong{recovered}: Individuals recovered with immunity (temporary or permanent).
\item \strong{deceased}: Individuals who died due to the disease.
\item \strong{incidence}: Flow representing new infections.
\item \strong{deaths}: Flow representing disease-induced deaths.
}

This vocabulary may be extended in future versions of the package.
