\title{Epidemiological roles vocabulary}
\usage{
.epi_role_vocab()
}
\value{
A character vector of valid epidemiological role names.
}
\description{
Defines the standard vocabulary of epidemiological roles supported by the
package. Roles assign semantic epidemiological meaning to \strong{state variables}
and \strong{flows} of an epidemic model (e.g. susceptible, infectious, incidence).

Roles are used to ensure semantic consistency across models and to enable
generic epidemiological metrics and visualisations.
}
\details{
Roles can only be assigned to:
\itemize{
\item state variables (e.g. \code{S}, \code{I}, \code{R}),
\item flows or auxiliary outputs (e.g. incidence, deaths).
}

Epidemiological roles \strong{must not} be assigned to model parameters
(e.g. transmission or recovery rates). Models declaring roles outside this
vocabulary, or assigning roles to parameters, will be rejected by
\code{epi_model()}.

The following roles are currently supported:

\itemize{
\item \strong{susceptible}: Individuals susceptible to infection.
\item \strong{exposed}: Infected but not yet infectious individuals.
\item \strong{infectious}: Infectious individuals.
\item \strong{recovered}: Individuals recovered with immunity (temporary or permanent).
\item \strong{deceased}: Individuals who died due to the disease.
\item \strong{incidence}: Flow representing new infections.
\item \strong{deaths}: Flow representing disease-induced deaths.
}

This vocabulary may be extended in future versions of the package.
