\title{Print method for epidemic model objects
Print an epidemic model object}
\usage{
\method{print}{epi_model}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
Provides a concise, human-readable summary of an \code{epi_model} object.
The printed output includes the model name, state variables, parameters,
the declared definition of epidemic incidence, and the underlying system
of differential equations.

This method is automatically called when an object of class
\code{"epi_model"} is printed at the console.
}
\details{
The \code{epi_model} class requires an explicit declaration of epidemic
incidence via the \code{incidence} field, which specifies the name of the
output returned by the model's right-hand side (\code{rhs}) corresponding
to the latent incidence rate. This information is displayed by the
\code{print()} method to make the epidemiological interpretation of the
model explicit.

Parameter bounds are shown when available. The model equations are printed
by deparsing the \code{rhs} function for inspection.
