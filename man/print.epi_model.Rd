\title{Print an epidemic model object}
\usage{
\method{print}{epi_model}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
Provides a concise, human-readable summary of an \code{epi_model} object.
The printed output includes the model name, state variables, parameters,
the declared model derived variables, and the underlying system of differential
equations.

This method is automatically called when an object of class
\code{"epi_model"} is printed at the console.
}
\details{
Model derived variables are shown when available.
These may include incidence, recoveries, or any other observable
returned by the model's right-hand side (\code{rhs}) function.

Parameter bounds are shown when available. The model equations are printed
by deparsing the \code{rhs} function for inspection.
