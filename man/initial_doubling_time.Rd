\title{Initial doubling time}
\usage{
initial_doubling_time(incidence, time, n = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence}{Numeric vector of incidence values.}

\item{time}{Numeric vector of time points.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of initial time points.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the doubling time.
}
\description{
Computes the epidemic doubling time during the initial exponential phase.
}
\details{
If incidence grows exponentially with rate \eqn{r},
the doubling time is:
\deqn{
T_d = \frac{\log 2}{r}.
}
}
