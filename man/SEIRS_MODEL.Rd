\title{SEIRS epidemic model with latent period and waning immunity}
\format{
An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.
}
\usage{
SEIRS_MODEL
}
\description{
An \code{epi_model} object representing a deterministic \strong{SEIRS}
(Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered–Susceptible) compartmental epidemic
model with a latent (exposed) period and waning immunity.

The model describes the spread of an infection in a closed population where
susceptible individuals become infected at rate \eqn{\lambda(t)} and enter
the exposed compartment \code{E}. Exposed individuals progress to the
infectious compartment at rate \code{sigma}. Infectious individuals recover
at rate \code{gamma}, and recovered individuals lose immunity at rate
\code{omega}, returning to the susceptible compartment.
}
\details{
\subsection{State variables}{

The model is defined in terms of the following state variables:
\describe{
\item{S(t)}{Number of susceptible individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{E(t)}{Number of exposed (infected but not yet infectious) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{I(t)}{Number of infectious (actively infected) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{R(t)}{Number of recovered individuals with temporary immunity at time \eqn{t}.}
}

The total population size is conserved:
\deqn{N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t).}
}

\subsection{Model variables}{

The SEIRS model declares the following variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{"S"}}{Susceptible population size.}
\item{\code{"E"}}{Exposed (latent) population size.}
\item{\code{"I"}}{Infectious population size.}
\item{\code{"R"}}{Recovered (temporarily immune) population size.}
\item{\code{"incidence"}}{Rate of progression from \code{E} to \code{I},
\eqn{\sigma E(t)}, representing the instantaneous incidence of new
infectious cases returned by the model's right-hand side.}
}

All declared variables may be used as observables in generic utilities
and summary methods built around \code{epi_model} objects.
}

\subsection{Parameters}{

The SEIRS model depends on the following parameters:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Transmission rate (per day).}
\item{sigma}{Rate of progression from exposed to infectious (per day);
\eqn{1/\sigma} is the mean latent period.}
\item{gamma}{Recovery/removal rate from infectious to recovered (per day);
\eqn{1/\gamma} is the mean infectious period.}
\item{omega}{Rate of waning immunity from \code{R} back to \code{S} (per day);
\eqn{1/\omega} is the mean immunity duration.}
}
}

\subsection{Model equations}{

New infections occur at rate
\deqn{\lambda(t) = \beta \frac{S(t)\, I(t)}{N}.}

Case incidence (entries into \code{I}) occurs at rate
\deqn{\text{incidence}(t) = \sigma E(t).}

The system of ordinary differential equations is:
\deqn{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\lambda(t) + \omega R(t), \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= \lambda(t) - \sigma E(t), \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \sigma E(t) - \gamma I(t), \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I(t) - \omega R(t).
\end{aligned}
}
}

\subsection{Usage}{

This predefined model object is intended to be used with generic utilities
such as \code{\link{simulate_epi}}, \code{\link{plot.sim_epi}}, and
\code{\link{summary.sim_epi}} that operate on \code{epi_model} objects.
