\title{Epidemiological role vocabulary}
\usage{
epi_role_vocab()
}
\value{
A named character vector mapping epidemiological state roles (names) to
default state variable names (values).
}
\description{
Defines the internal vocabulary of epidemiological roles supported by the
framework.
}
\details{
This vocabulary is restricted to \emph{state roles only}. Epidemiological roles
describe the semantic meaning of compartmental state variables (e.g.
susceptible, infectious) and are used to provide a model-independent way of
referring to core epidemiological concepts.

Flows are intentionally excluded from the role system. Flow variables are
treated as implementation details or optional model outputs and are not
required to have epidemiological roles.
\subsection{State roles}{

The vocabulary defines the set of supported epidemiological state roles and
their default associated state variable names. The returned vector maps role
names (keys) to default state names (values).

The following state roles are currently supported:

\describe{
\item{\code{susceptible}}{
Individuals who are not infected and are at risk of infection.
By default, associated with the state variable \code{"S"}.
}
\item{\code{exposed}}{
Individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious.
By default, associated with the state variable \code{"E"}.
}
\item{\code{infectious}}{
Individuals who are currently infectious and capable of transmitting
the pathogen.
By default, associated with the state variable \code{"I"}.
}
\item{\code{recovered}}{
Individuals who have recovered from infection and are no longer
infectious.
By default, associated with the state variable \code{"R"}.
}
\item{\code{deceased}}{
Individuals who have died as a consequence of the disease.
By default, associated with the state variable \code{"D"}.
}
}
}

\subsection{Use in \code{epi_model()}}{

The vocabulary is used by \code{epi_model()} to:

\itemize{
\item Infer state roles automatically when \code{roles = NULL}.
\item Validate user-defined state role assignments.
\item Ensure that all model states have an epidemiological role.
}

All state variables declared in an \code{epi_model} must be identifiable
through this vocabulary or explicitly assigned by the user. If a state
cannot be mapped to a role, model construction fails.
