SEIR epidemic model with latent (exposed) period}
\format{
An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.
}
\usage{
SEIR_MODEL
}
\description{
An \code{epi_model} object representing a deterministic \strong{SEIR}
(Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered) compartmental epidemic model
with a latent period. Individuals become infected at rate \eqn{\lambda(t)}
and enter the exposed compartment \code{E}. Exposed individuals progress
to the infectious compartment at rate \code{sigma}.
}
\details{
\subsection{State variables}{

The model is defined in terms of the following state variables:
\describe{
\item{S(t)}{Number of susceptible individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{E(t)}{Number of exposed (infected but not yet infectious) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{I(t)}{Number of infectious (actively infected) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{R(t)}{Number of recovered (immune) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
}

The total population size is given by
\deqn{N = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t),}
which is conserved by the model dynamics.
}

\subsection{Parameters}{

The SEIR model depends on the following parameters:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Transmission rate (per day).}
\item{sigma}{Rate of progression from \code{E} to \code{I} (per day), so \eqn{1/\sigma} is the mean latent period.}
\item{gamma}{Recovery/removal rate from \code{I} to \code{R} (per day), so \eqn{1/\gamma} is the mean infectious period.}
}
}

\subsection{Model equations}{

New infections occur at rate
\deqn{\lambda(t) = \beta \frac{S(t)\, I(t)}{N}.}

Progression from exposed to infectious occurs at rate
\deqn{\text{incidence}(t) = \sigma E(t).}

The system of ordinary differential equations is:
\deqn{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\lambda(t), \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= \lambda(t) - \sigma E(t), \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \sigma E(t) - \gamma I(t), \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I(t),
\end{aligned}
}
}

\subsection{Usage}{

This predefined model object is intended to be used with generic utilities
such as \code{\link{simulate_epi}} and model-fitting functions that operate
on \code{epi_model} objects.
