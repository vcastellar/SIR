\title{SIRS epidemic model with waning immunity}
\format{
An object of class \code{"epi_model"}.
}
\usage{
SIRS_MODEL
}
\description{
An \code{epi_model} object representing a deterministic \strong{SIRS}
(Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered–Susceptible) compartmental epidemic model
with waning immunity.

The model describes the spread of an infection in a closed population where
susceptible individuals become infectious, subsequently recover, and may
lose immunity over time, returning to the susceptible compartment at rate
\code{omega}.
}
\details{
\subsection{State variables}{

The model is defined in terms of the following state variables:
\describe{
\item{S(t)}{Number of susceptible individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{I(t)}{Number of infectious (actively infected) individuals at time \eqn{t}.}
\item{R(t)}{Number of recovered individuals with temporary immunity at time \eqn{t}.}
}

The total population size is conserved:
\deqn{N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t).}
}

\subsection{Model outputs}{

The SIRS model declares the following outputs:
\describe{
\item{\code{"S"}}{Susceptible population size.}
\item{\code{"I"}}{Infectious population size.}
\item{\code{"R"}}{Recovered (temporarily immune) population size.}
\item{\code{"incidence"}}{Instantaneous rate of new infections
\eqn{\lambda(t)} returned by the model's right-hand side.}
}

All declared outputs may be used as observables in generic utilities such as
\code{\link{fit_epi_model}} via the \code{target} argument.
}

\subsection{Parameters}{

The SIRS model depends on the following parameters:
\describe{
\item{beta}{Transmission rate (per day).}
\item{gamma}{Recovery/removal rate (per day).}
\item{omega}{Rate of waning immunity from \code{R} back to \code{S} (per day).}
}
}

\subsection{Model equations}{

New infections occur at rate
\deqn{\lambda(t) = \beta \frac{S(t)\, I(t)}{N}.}

The system of ordinary differential equations is:
\deqn{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\lambda(t) + \omega R(t), \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \lambda(t) - \gamma I(t), \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I(t) - \omega R(t). \\
\end{aligned}
}
}

\subsection{Usage}{

This predefined model object is intended to be used with generic utilities
such as \code{\link{simulate_epi}}, \code{\link{fit_epi_model}}, and
\code{\link{predict.fit_epi_model}} that operate on \code{epi_model} objects.

## Simulate a SIRS epidemic
sim <- simulate_epi(
  model = SIRS_MODEL,
  times = 0:200,
  parms = c(beta = 0.3, gamma = 0.1, omega = 0.02),
  init  = c(S = 1e6, I = 20, R = 0)

plot(sim)

## Plot observed incidence (if an observation model is used)
plot(sim, what = "incidence")
