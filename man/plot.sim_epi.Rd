\usage{
\method{plot}{sim_epi}(
  x,
  what = c("states", "incidence"),
  scale = c("auto", "full", "small", "log"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}.}

\item{what}{Character string specifying the type of plot to produce.
Either \code{"states"} to plot compartmental state trajectories or
\code{"incidence"} to plot observed incidence counts.}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale for state plots.
One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"full"}, \code{"small"}, or \code{"log"}.
This argument is ignored when \code{what = "incidence"}.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to base plotting
functions such as \code{\link{plot}} and \code{\link{matplot}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.

\description{
Plot method for objects of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}. The function can display either the
compartmental state trajectories defined by the underlying
\code{\link{epi_model}} or the observed incidence time series,
depending on the value of the \code{what} argument.

Unlike earlier versions, this method does not assume a specific
compartmental structure (e.g. SIR or SEIR). The set of states to be
plotted is taken directly from the \code{epi_model} used to generate
the simulation.
}
\details{
When \code{what = "states"}, the function plots the time evolution of
all state variables defined in \code{x$model$state_names}, using the
simulated trajectories stored in \code{x$states}. The time variable
is taken from the \code{time} column of \code{x$states} and is not
considered a state.

When \code{what = "incidence"}, the function plots the observed
incidence counts generated by the observation model and stored in
\code{x$incidence}. If no observation model was specified during
simulation (i.e. \code{obs = "none"}), this option results in an error.

\examples{
sim <- simulate_epi(
  model = SIR_MODEL,
  n_days = 200,
  parms = c(beta = 0.3, gamma = 0.1),
  init  = c(S = 999990, I = 10, R = 0, C = 10),
  obs   = "poisson",
  seed  = 1
)

# Plot all model states
plot(sim)

# Plot observed incidence (requires an observation model)
plot(sim, what = "incidence")
