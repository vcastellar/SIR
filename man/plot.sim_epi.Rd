\usage{
\method{plot}{sim_epi}(x, what = "states", scale = c("auto", "full", "small", "log"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}.}

\item{what}{Character string specifying what to plot. One of:
\code{"states"} (all state variables),
\code{"derived"} (all model derived variables),
or the name of a single model state/derived variable
(e.g. \code{"I"}, \code{"S"}, \code{"incidence"}).}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale for state plots.
One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"full"}, \code{"small"}, or \code{"log"}.
This argument is only used when \code{what = "states"}.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to base plotting
functions such as \code{\link{plot}} and \code{\link{matplot}}.}

\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.

\description{
Plot method for objects of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}. The function provides a flexible visualization
interface for simulated epidemic trajectories by allowing the user to plot
either all model states, all model derived variables, or a single state/derived variable.

Unlike earlier versions, this method does not assume a specific
compartmental structure (e.g. SIR or SEIR). All available quantities that can
be plotted are taken directly from the states and derived variables declared in the
underlying \code{\link{epi_model}} used to generate the simulation.
}
\details{
The behavior of the function depends on the value of the \code{what} argument:

\itemize{
\item{\code{what = "states"}}{Plots the time evolution of all state variables
defined in \code{x$model$states}, using the simulated trajectories
stored in \code{x$states}. The time variable is taken from the
\code{time} column of \code{x$states} and is not considered a state.}

\item{\code{what = "derived"}}{Plots the time evolution of all derived variables
defined in \code{x$model$derived}, using the simulated trajectories
stored in \code{x$derived}. The time variable is taken from the
\code{time} column.}

\item{\code{what = <var>}}{Plots a single state/derived variable, where
\code{<var>} is the name of one state in \code{x$model$states}
(e.g. \code{"I"}, \code{"S"}, \code{"R"}) or one derived variable in
\code{x$model$derived} (e.g. \code{"incidence"}). The corresponding
trajectory is extracted from \code{x$states} when it is a state, and
from \code{x$derived} when it is derived.}
}

If available, the time unit stored in the \code{sim_epi} object
(i.e. \code{x$time_unit}) is used to label the time axis. This affects only the
plot labels and does not change the numerical values of time.
