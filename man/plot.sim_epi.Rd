\usage{
\method{plot}{sim_epi}(
  x,
  what = c("states", "incidence"),
  include_C = FALSE,
  scale = c("auto", "full", "small", "log"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}.}

\item{what}{Character. Type of plot to produce. Either \code{"states"} for the
compartmental trajectories (S, E, I, R) or \code{"incidence"} for the observed
incidence time series.}

\item{include_C}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and the state \code{C} is present,
include cumulative infections in the state plot.}

\item{scale}{Character. Scale for state plots. One of \code{"auto"},
\code{"full"}, \code{"small"}, or \code{"log"}.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters passed to base plotting functions
such as \code{\link{plot}} and \code{\link{lines}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.

\description{
Plot method for objects of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}. The function can display either the compartmental
state trajectories (S, E, I, R) or the observed incidence time series, depending
on the value of the \code{what} argument. When plotting states, the function
can optionally include cumulative infections and adjust the display scale.
}
\details{
When \code{what = "states"}, the function plots the time evolution of the
susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) compartments
on the same figure when available. When \code{what = "incidence"}, the function plots the observed
incidence counts generated by the observation model.

This method is automatically dispatched when calling \code{plot()} on an
object of class \code{"sim_epi"}.
}
\examples{
sim <- simulate_epi(n_days = 200, model = SIR_MODEL, seed = 1)

# Plot S, I, R trajectories
plot(sim)

# Plot observed incidence
plot(sim, what = "incidence")
