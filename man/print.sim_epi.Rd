\title{Print a simulated epidemic}
\usage{
\method{print}{sim_epi}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments ignored by this method; included for
compatibility with the generic \code{\link{print}} function.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
Print method for objects of class \code{"sim_epi"} as returned by
\code{\link{simulate_epi}}. The function provides a concise, human-readable
summary of a simulated epidemic, including the underlying epidemic model,
the simulation time horizon, the parameter values used, and selected outcome
metrics derived from the simulation results.

Unlike earlier versions, this method does not assume a specific compartmental
structure (such as SIR or SEIR). Model-specific information is obtained directly
from the \code{\link{epi_model}} object stored in \code{x$model}.
}
\details{
This method is automatically dispatched when an object of class
\code{"sim_epi"} is printed. It is intended to give a quick overview of the
simulation without displaying the full internal structure of the object.

The printed output typically includes:
\itemize{
\item the name of the epidemic model,
\item the simulated time horizon,
\item the parameter values used in the simulation,
\item basic outcome summaries (e.g. peak prevalence or total infections),
when such quantities are available.
}

  init  = c(S = 999990, I = 10, R = 0, C = 10),
  seed  = 1
