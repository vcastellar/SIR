Description: 
    Tools for simulating and analyzing deterministic compartmental epidemic
    models using ordinary differential equations. The package currently
    supports classical SIR and SIRS models, including cumulative infection
    tracking and stochastic observation processes based on Poisson or
    negative binomial likelihoods. The output of simulations is returned as
    a dedicated S3 object with associated plotting and summary methods,
    facilitating reproducible epidemic modeling workflows.
